      <h1>A <em>really cool</em> Email service</h1>
      <p>
        Do you want a <i>really cool</i> email address? Say, yourname@reallycool.email? Well, if you do(and you know that you do), then this is the place!
        <br>
        Just <a href="mailto:get@reallycool.email">hit me up</a> and I'll set you up with the <em>coolest</em> email address you've ever had.
        Except maybe your <a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> address. But besides that, it's the best one out there.
        <br>
        Let's be honest. It's pretty cool. Get one. You know you want to.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h1>Here's the deal.</h1>
      <p>You get an email address that you choose- probably something like yourname@reallycool.email. There are two options(and you can switch later if you change your mind!)
        <br>
        Option one:You can't <em>send</em> Email from this address, 
         However, you <em>do</em> get any email sent to that address 
        fowarded on to your main email address(youname@gmail.com? anemail@example.org? thebestemailaddresseverlol@yourname.tech?). Whatever email address you normally 
        use, everything will get fowarded to. <br>
        Option two: You get a mailbox espically for this address, which can be set up to foward to your normal inbox, but it's more difficult. However, you can
        send email from it. There are only limited spots with this option, so get in quick!
        <br> And the best part? Either way, it's <em>free</em>. Completley free. Doesn't cost a single dollar. Donations are of course welcome, 
        and any money send to me for this service, will be used on this service- domain renewals, better servers, etc. 
        Just <a href="mailto:luke@omg.lol">email me</a> and I'll figure out some way to take money off your hands(I might set up an easier way in the future, but for now I can't be bothered)
        <br>
        That's the end of my sales pitch(Is it still a sales pitch if I'm not accepting money?). I hope you'll choose to use this wonderful thing I've made, but even if you don't, you're still prettty cool for at least having a look. :)</p>
