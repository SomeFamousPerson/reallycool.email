      <h1>A <em>really cool</em> Email service</h1>
      <p>
        Do you want a <i>really cool</i> email address? Say, yourname@reallycool.email? Well, if you do(and you know that you do), then this is the place!
        <br>
        Just <a href="mailto:get@reallycool.email">hit me up</a> and I'll set you up with the <em>coolest</em> email address you've ever had.
        Except maybe your <a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> adresss. But besides that, it's the best one out there.
        <br>
        Let's be honest. It's pretty cool. Get one. You know you want to.
