      <h1>A <em>really cool</em> Email service</h1>
      <p>
        Do you want a <i>really cool</i> email address? Say, yourname@reallycool.email? Well, if you do(and you know that you do), then this is the place!
        <br>
        Just <a href="mailto:get@reallycool.email">hit me up</a> and I'll set you up with the <em>coolest</em> email address you've ever had.
        Except maybe your <a href="https://omg.lol">omg.lol</a> address. But besides that, it's the best one out there.
        <br>
        Let's be honest. It's pretty cool. Get one. You know you want to.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h1>Here's the deal.</h1>
      <p>You get an email address that you choose- probably something like yourname@reallycool.email. You can't <em>send</em> Email from this address, 
        as setting that up costs large amounts of money, and large amounts of money is something I lack. However, you <em>do</em> get any email sent to that address 
        fowarded on to your main email address(youname@gmail.com? anemail@example.org? thebestemailaddresseverlol@yourname.tech?). Whatever email address you normally 
        use, everything will get fowarded to. And the best part? It's <em>free</em>. Completley free. Doesn't cost a single dollar. Donations are of course welcome, 
        and any money send to me for this service, will be used on this service- domain renewals, better servers, getting email sending set up, etc. 
        Just <a href="mailto:luke@reallycool.email">email me</a> and I'll figure out some way to take money off your hands(I might set up an easier way in the future, but for now I can't be bothered)
        <br>
        That's the end of my sales pitch(Is it still a sales pitch if I'm not selling anything?). I hope you'll choose to use this wonderful thing I've made, but even if you don't, you're still prettty cool for at least having a look. :)
